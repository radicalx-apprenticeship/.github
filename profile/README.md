RadicalX's mission is to provide 1+ Billion students and early career professionals in the world the opportunity to develop their dream career in the innovation economy for free without barriers like price, location, prior experience, or socio-economic background being an obstacle. 

## About Apprenticeship
Companies working with RadicalX want to be able to provide 3-6 month paid apprenticeships to the top talent coming out of
the RadicalX internship program. RadicalX Apprenticeships enable companies to discover, build and manage a cloud team to
work on specific projects, on-demand. The idea is that companies will be able to build and onboard an apprentice team in
days and it will allow them Pay-as-you-go flexibility. In order to do this, companies need to be able to create an apprenticeship
on the RadicalX platform.


### Problem to solve

Companies currently set up management trainee programs for candidates that pass their interview stages. The churn rate for
these programs is very high as these candidates know very less about the company and their process beforehand. The
apprenticeship alloWs companies to reduce this effort and begin solving real problems with the top candidate.

### Success

If a company is able to set up an apprenticeship program on RadicalX and successfully hire a team on contractual basis.
